Files (a MediaWiki extension)
=============================

Files is a MediaWiki extension to improve the handling of files. As of this writing, all it does is add a parser function, {{#file: ... }}, which adds a "file info" link along with links to files, and makes the main link directly to the file. This makes it less confusing for people inexperienced with MediaWiki to click on file links and actually get to the file itself, rather than the file information page which may not be useful to them.
